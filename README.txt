How to use application:

The application will open on the recognition screen. Switch over to the addition screen in order to add new gestures by drawing a one-stroke gesture then clicking okay. You must draw a gesture and input text before clicking okay or else the application will not register the gesture. You can clear the current drawing on the screen.

To see your current gestures, open the library tab and you can scroll through, view the gestures, and delete whichever ones you would like.

On the recognition screen, you can draw whatever one-stroke gesture and the application will show you at most the top 3 most similar gestures that exist in your library.
